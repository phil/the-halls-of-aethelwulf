The Halls of Aethelwulf

An ancient medieval citadel has been discovered under the Welsh Mountains, with help from documents obtained from the Mars Base during the first invasion of Hells forces. A team of archiologists has been sent in to learn more about the connections between the ancient martian civilisation, and medieval Britain.

But contact with the archaeologist team has been lost … you’ve been sent in to clear the citadel.

Doom 2 Single player
Map: 01
Name: The Halls of Aethelwulf
Difficulty: only UV
Secrets: Yes, pretty simple/obvious to find, I didn’t want to make them hard to find as the map is pretty big, and it would be no fun trying to find them. You do not need the secrets to beat the map … but they help.
Build: 10-15 hours.
Style: Vanilla Doom2, collect the keys, kill the bad guys, no jumping, free-look if you like (but that might spoil the atmosphere).

Tested on GZdoom. This is a large and dark map, I’m using “Legacy” rendering on GZDoom, but “Standard” also works well, any other option, and it might be too dark to see what you’re doing.

I think there’s plenty of Ammo and Health, but any feedback on adding/removing any more would be appreciated, as well as feed back on the traps and monster closets.
